# alviny-task-12

It's a Raycaster.

## Controls

Use arrow keys to move around the level.

## How to run

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IndaPlus25/alviny-task-12.git
```

Then, navigate to the program folder and run the application:

```bash
cd alviny-task-12
./raycaster.exe
```

You can also define custom maps. To do this, create a text file with the file ending .lvl and put your level there. Every space is a walkable space, and every wall is a \# symbol. Then, run with the following:

```bash

./raycaster.exe "path/to/your/level-file.lvl"
```
